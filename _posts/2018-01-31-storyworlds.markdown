In the storyworlds course we explored the process of creating a fictional universe and telling a story within it. 
Our demo follows the hero Kalatel, who must warn the kindom of Meeret of an invasion of the Ina-driis from the land of Driisadi. After witnessing the literal collapse of the main city KERA, the hero and his friends must find their way into the locked-down Serena to warn the population. 
The hero has to interact with various NPCs and solve puzzles including finding and combining objects to advance the games story.
