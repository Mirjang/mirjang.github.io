We simplified the [Newton-Cotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas) formulas for n=1,2 and implemented them in ARM assembly. The implementation was compared against different levels of compiler optimization. For 1 million runs our implementation was only 8ms slower than the C implementation using the highest compiler optimization.
