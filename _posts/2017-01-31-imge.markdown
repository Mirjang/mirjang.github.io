In the third semester of our games bachelor we created a game based on the cactus controller (named after all the exposed soldering poins :)) for the interaction methods lecture. The game featured a continuous horde of zombies chasing the player. The player could fight the zombies with various weapons which had to be selected using the rotating knob and reloaded by moving one of the silders down and up. A custom modification in the form of a rubber band turned the second slider into a "gun trigger". The payer could move by tilting the controller. Gestures could be used to free the player form zombies that came to close and captured them. The gesures were recognized using Markov Chains.
